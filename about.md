I get excited discovering new technologies and I'm fascinated by all the enhancement in the world of graphic design.

I'm excited about the future of prototyping digital product.

I'm fascinated by the movement and in the consequence it can have in attention.

I'm fascinated by how we remember things and how perceive them.

T shaped expertise


I feel like there are so many things to learn.. There are days in which at the end I stop to reflect and i realize there are many things that i learned today, but i've also found even more things I'd like to learn.

Right now my main objective is experimenting a little bit in all these fields to better understand where I'd like to specialize.
